Poverty compounded by isolation creates unthinkable challenges for families and often these challenges – and the outcomes they create – are repeated from one generation leaving little hope for better futures. The children are at the heart of these challenges and are the ones to suffer most.

In southeastern Missouri, there is a hidden pocket of poverty where thousands of families are trying to manage the challenges of isolation and poverty on their own. Whole Kids Outreach is there to help. We are there to help, because in our area …

… one-third of the children live below the poverty line.

… births to teen mothers is 50% higher than the state of Missouri overall.

… the area’s infant mortality rate is a staggering 11.2%.

… the children need us.

With warmth and compassion, Whole Kids Outreach has been helping hundreds of families every year since 1999.

Whole Kids Outreach is a faith-based nonprofit working to address the unmet health and wellness needs of hundreds of children living in rural poverty in Missouri. The WKO service area includes the counties of Butler, Carter, Iron, Reynolds, Shannon and Wayne and encompasses nearly 5,000 square miles.
